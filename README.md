# Tech-vs-People_Final-Project
This is my final project for my Quantitative Research Methods course where I analyzed effects of race, age, sex, income, religion, wealth, and level of education completed on new technology, specifically measuring whether or not individuals feel that implementing new technology in the workforce is beneficial and a good idea. 
## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "elias2-chi2.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, please utilize the GSS Data Explorer exclusively using variables and data from 2022.
## **Data**
My research uses data collected by the General Social Survey. The General Social Survey (GSS) interviews respondents of ages 18 and older from the United States in order to record and track changing beliefs and opinions about a wide variety of different topics and questions. Their data collection also involves assigning respondents to one of three different ballots, A, B, and C, where each ballot is composed of different questions, meaning that not every ballot consists of every question the GSS asked for that year. For my data, my sample size consists of 270 of the total 4,149 respondents the GSS surveyed during 2022, and uses data from each of the three ballots. These surveys are also mostly conducted in person as interviews and occur every two years. This is one of the reasons why my sample total doesnâ€™t match the number of total respondents, as surveys are administered to two samples in even-numbered years, and some questions are asked in only one of the two samples. When looking at our data we also excluded respondents who skipped the question, did not or could not choose an answer, those who simply had no answer, and those where the question was not applicable to them. Our target population is all adults in the United States who are part of the workforce and use and implement new science and technologies. We aim to find if these individuals believe technology is beneficial in the workforce based on our sample of respondents who provided answers to questions/categories from the GSS that can be seen in the table below.
