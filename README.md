# Tech-vs-People_Final-Project
This is my final project for my Quantitative Research Methods course where I analyzed effects of race, age, sex, income, religion, wealth, and level of education completed on new technology, specifically measuring whether or not individuals feel that implementing new technology in the workforce is beneficial and a good idea.
